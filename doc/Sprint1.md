  ### Good
  
  * Completed our tasks and kept everyone up-to-date in our group.
  * Connor did an amazing job on overall coding.
  * Chad did an awesome job on visual and explaining architecture.
  * We had our server display the data on a browser, coded in the backhand server.
  * Everyone helped each other working around Webstorm and anything that needed understanding.  
  
  ### Bad
  
  * Even though everyone was up-to-date and quick to help, we still need to meet more than twice a week. 
  * Pushing and pulling files did cause a commotion.
  * Had trouble setting up our project's tab on GitHub.
  
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * As a team, we will keep everyone up-to-date on our project and their tasks.
  * Every group member, in their own time, would spend time researching and learning more about our project's requirements as they arise.

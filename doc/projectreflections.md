My experience with this project so far has been good. My most recent task was when we did the tesing in he last sprint. During the last sprint we did some teating to see if the 
app component and profile componet would work and they worked very good. Both of the items we used to see if they worked stayed there and none o them had any huge problems.

Conners experience: When he was talking to Professor Sexton over discord he discoverd that he needed to switch over to angular for our website because we needed a front end frame work
Instead of having straight HTML and CSS which did not work for our situation. Also he needed angular so he could connect the data to the front end website so a client/user could
see it and interact with all of the components that we had created for the website.

Harris experience: His experience has been good. He has mostly worked on the deliverables side of the project such as creating md files and rigor projects on github. At first they seemed pointless and effortless but as he kept working on them, they serve a genuine purpose to every part in out project. From sprint 1 to 4, each will show you how far our project has progressed and how we worked well as a software development team.

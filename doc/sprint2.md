  ## Demo
  
  This sprint, we completed:

  * Wrote code in JavaScript & TypeScript
  * Wrote all of that code using Angular framework
  * Created a search box on our website
  * Made it to where we could type-in in the search box
  * Started connecting the angular backend to the frontend

  ## Retro
  
  [What is a Sprint Retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective)
  
  ### Good
  
  * We communicated more often than our last sprint
  * Started early on our assigned tasks
  * Harris and Chad helped conner with code debugging
  
  ### Bad
  
  * We communicated more often but sometimes we could not finish what we planned
  * We need to diverse our tasks, so we do not keep doing the same stuff
  
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * All of us needs to work on coding so everyone is on the same page.

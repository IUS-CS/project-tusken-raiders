our website will have many diffetent types of design patterns in it.
some of the big ones are the observer pattern.
This pattern will allow us to be bale to push things ont our website and then change it based off of what we want it to do.
For example when we want to put the lastest file on the page in the latest update all we will need to do is make a command that will specifically put it inside of the main spectrum
then we will move the old file before that to the previous file sections with an automated system that we do not need the client seeing when or how it was moved the only thing we need
the client to see if the file that was added to the previous section.

We will use the factory method to do the system I just spoke about how moving it around without the client seeing it.

We will also use the abstract factory to do the system of how to compare the 2 files and see what we need to change with it.
this system will allow us to put the data inside of an array and compare them with each other and see if the ID numbers match up if yes then they will go to the first collum,
if not then they will go to the second collum and the second one says that we do not need to change any of the items inside of this array because they do not have anything in common
with the new file that got uploaded.

The final one we will be using is the prototype design pattern which will allow us to put all of the items that have been changed into a new file and then display that to the client
this will show the client, how many were changed, which ones were changed, and what was the latest instance of them before the change occured.

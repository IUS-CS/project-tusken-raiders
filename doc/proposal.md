Our website will be a place where someone can access a place to update their prices on goods such as a grocery store getting their sale updates.

This website will also be able to run a system check and have pictures of the sales items if the time frame allows it. 
This system check will search their file system inside of their computer for a base model of the prices.
Once the file has been found it will then search the file and match the ID of the item in both files and then it will check the price.
If the price is found incorrect then the system will correct it.
If it is the same then it will keep it the same.
At the end of the program running it will then show all of the ID's of the items that it has changed and all of the prices it changed to.

If in the case of our program can not find the file it will prompt the user to run our program using the file in the command line and manually open all of it.
If the file does not have any changes it will show no changes.
If the program does not have correct access to the file it will then prompt the user to run it inside of admin and then access the program and file via the command line.

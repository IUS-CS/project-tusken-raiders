During our time testing we tested a couple of different things 2 of the big ones were the app component and the profile component.
Within these 2 items whenever we would run then inside of the app compoment side it should create the app structure, and should have the title 'store product inquiry searcher'.
It was successful with both of these showing it as the title and the base app being created with no issues.

the next pat was the profile: within this we did 2 main things a way for the user to select a item they want to search for and a profile container to be created.
what we did was add a bunch of different types of stored items by the name of it. Eventually we will get it to the point where the user will be able to search the repository for
an item based off of the sku or item number which ever one we decide to do.
We created the saying of when whenver it would start up 'no store item selected! Store team member please select or enter an item to search for.'
This will just be any easy way for people to know what to do at this specific step.

We then added a bunch of items to the stored section such as apples, pears, lettuce, peppers, potatoes. Just to see if the stored selection would show if it has anything inside
of it. 

In the end we ran into a couple of bugs inside of the code that showed the app not wanting to be completed and then there were some issues with the profile not wanting to generate
the specific words that we wanted.

  ### Good
  
  * Everyone showed enthusiasm in project as we keep progressing
  * Discussed and separated our work earlier in the week
  * Conner got in touch with group members right after sprint3 and discussed work
  
  ### Bad
  
  * We need to change up our tasks a bit 
  * Communication was good but there were gaps in our timing which delayed work a bit
  
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * We need to start discussing on our website's visuals
